This project was inspired by the excellent work and thoughtful community contributions of:

**Ashley Willis** - For her insightful article ["Turning Feedback into Features"](https://ashley.dev/posts/turning-feedback-into-features/) and her beautifully crafted [terminal business card implementation](https://github.com/ashleymcnamara/ashley.dev-card). Her approach to making developer tools more human and joyful provided the perfect blueprint for this professional adaptation.
